    <h1>Google Data Analytics Capstone Project</h1>
    <h2 class="main-page">
      Case study: World Bank's world development indicators
    </h2>
    <h3>Business Task</h3>
    <p>
      A fictional non-governmental organization wants to start projects in
      Myanmar and they would like to know which areas are in need of more
      development in order for them to start investing time and money in those
      areas. They are especially interested in development in health and
      education. <br /><br />As a junior data analyst, I have been tasked to
      explore World Development Indicator Data available on Big Query Public
      Data specific to Myanmar country and make recommendations based on
      analysis specifically in health and education sectors.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Source</h3>
    <p>
      Data source is available at <em>bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi</em>.
    </p>
    <img

    src="WDI screenshot.jpg" alt="Dataset Info" />
    <h3>Tools used</h3>

    <p>The following data analytics tools are used for this project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>SQL</strong> to query data</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> for data cleaning, manipulation and
        initial analysis
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tableau Public</strong> for data analysis and visualizations
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1. Querying data</h3>
    <p>
      SQL script below shows that the dataset contains development indicator
      data of <strong>265</strong> countries.
    </p>

    <pre>
SELECT DISTINCT country_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`</pre
    >
    <p>
      The following SQL code shows that data is available from
      <strong>1960 to 2020</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT min(year),max(year)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
</pre
    >
    <p>
      The following SQL query is run in order to retrieve data specific to
      Myanmar and saved the file in Excel format.
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
WHERE country_name='Myanmar'
</pre
    >
    <h3>2. Cleaning and Manipulation of data</h3>
    <p>
      Cleaning and manipulation of data are done in
      <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>. There are 1310 unique development
      indicators for Myanmar. <br /><br />The steps of cleaning and manipulation
      involve separating each development indicator into the same category,
      filtering them and copying them into different files and pivoting and
      transposing data for easy analysis.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Analysis and Visualizations</h3>
    <p>
      Initial analysis was done in Excel and visualizations are done in Tableau
      Public Desktop and
      <a
        href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lydia.lydia5418/vizzes"
        target="_blank"
        >published on Tableau Public</a
      >.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      In terms of population, more female population than male population with
      50% of urban population dwelling in slums. <br /><br />More males than
      females achieve basic education but more females than male attain tertiary
      level education. <br /><br />Health-wise, in general, females live longer
      than males. Stunting and wasting are very common in the country with more
      males than females prone to them. <br /><br />Death from communicable
      diseases are declining but death from lifestyle diseases such as cancer,
      diabetes and heart diseases are increasing.
    </p>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      Therefore, it is recommended to invest more in female education since
      female makes up the bigger population and they tend to persevere till
      tertiary education. And it is also recommended to create more job
      opportunities for women because right now, more male than female are in
      the labor market with female unemployment being high. <br /><br />It will
      also be wise to invest more in men healthcare since they seem to live
      shorter and male children are more prone to stunting and wasting.
    </p>
    <h3>Deliverables for further exploration</h3>
    <p>
      Since non-communicable (lifestyle) diseases are on the rise, it will be
      necessary to collect more data on what types of lifestyle diseases are
      prevalent; what lifestyle factors contribute to the diseases, and then
      provide programs to alleviate such diseases.
