    <h1>Google Data Analytics Capstone Project</h1>
    <h2 class="main-page">
      Case study: World Bank's world development indicators
    </h2>
    <h3>Business Task</h3>
    <p>
      A fictional non-governmental organization wants to start projects in
      Myanmar and they are especially interested in health and education
      developments. <br /><br />As a junior data analyst, I have been tasked to
      explore World Development Indicator Data available on Big Query Public
      Data specific to Myanmar country and make recommendations based on
      analysis specifically in health and education sectors.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Source</h3>
    <p>
      Data source is available at
      <em class="datasource">bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi</em>.
    </p>
    <img
    /*src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/150/287/original/WDI_screenshot.jpg?1731552632"*/
    src="WDI screenshot.jpg" alt="Dataset Info" />
    <h3>Tools used</h3>

    <p>
      The following <strong>data analytics tools</strong> are used for this
      project:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>SQL</strong> to query data</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> for data cleaning, manipulation and
        initial analysis
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tableau Public</strong> for data analysis and visualizations
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1. Querying data</h3>
    <p>
      SQL script below shows that the dataset contains development indicator
      data of <strong>265</strong> countries.
    </p>

    <pre>
SELECT DISTINCT country_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`</pre
    >
    <p>
      The following SQL code shows that data is available from
      <strong>1960 to 2020</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT min(year),max(year)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
</pre
    >
    <p>
      The following SQL query is run in order to retrieve data specific to
      Myanmar and saved the file in Excel format.
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
WHERE country_name='Myanmar'
</pre
    >
    <h3>2. Cleaning and Manipulation of data</h3>
    <p>
      Cleaning and manipulation of data are done in
      <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>. There are <strong>1310</strong> unique
      development indicators for Myanmar. <br /><br />The steps of cleaning and
      manipulation involve separating each development indicator into the same
      category, checking for duplicates, filtering them and copying them into
      different files and pivoting and transposing data for easy analysis.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Analysis and Visualizations</h3>
    <p>
      Initial analysis was done in <strong>Excel</strong> and visualizations are
      done in <strong>Tableau Public Desktop</strong> and
      <a
        href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lydia.lydia5418/vizzes"
        target="_blank"
        >published on Tableau Public</a
      >.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      In education, more males than females achieve basic education but more
      females than male attain tertiary level education.
      <br /><br />In health sector, majority of expenses come from
      out-of-pocket.<br /><br />Females live longer than males in general.
      Stunting and wasting are very common in the country with more males than
      females prone to them. <br /><br />Death from communicable diseases are
      declining but death from lifestyle diseases such as cancer, diabetes and
      heart diseases are increasing especially among men.
    </p>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      Therefore, it is recommended to invest more in female education since
      female makes up the bigger population and they tend to persevere till
      tertiary education. It is also recommended to create more job
      opportunities for women because right now, more male than female are in
      the labor market with female unemployment being high. <br /><br />It will
      also be wise to invest more in male healthcare because they seem to live
      shorter; male children are more prone to stunting and wasting, and males'
      mortality from lifestyle diseases are above females'. Moreover, since the
      government is not doing enough to subsidize individual's healthcare
      expenses, we can provide programs designed to ease financial burdens on
      individuals for healthcare.
    </p>
    <h3>Further exploration</h3>
    <p>
      Since non-communicable (lifestyle) diseases are on the rise, it will be
      necessary to collect more data on what types of lifestyle diseases are
      prevalent; what lifestyle factors contribute to the diseases, and then
      provide programs to alleviate such diseases.
